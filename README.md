# parsemake
parses a makefile
The goal was a proof of concept for me to parse makefiles for use in tab completion for fish-shell.
The project might never be completely finished or compliant with the makefile spec. but it will do for my needs. 

Heavily inspired from https://github.com/mrtazz/checkmake
